Leap Motion Python Template
===========================

This is a template project for the Leap Motion's Python API.
It contains the bare minimum of files required to run the "Sample.py"
script, which interfaces with the Leap at a very basic level.

Notes
-----
* Requires Python 2.7 (though other versions *may* work - **untested!**)
* Requires Leap Motion device software to be installed
* Uses Leap Motion SDK (version 1.0.9)
